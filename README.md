Created with jekyll

# Using

```
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve --watch

# SASS

**Do** touch the files in the bitters folder. They are just a good starting point.
However, leave the `bourbon` and `neat` folders alone, they are libs, and might get updated later.

Also, styles that doesn't fit in one of the bitters files may be added to main.scss or a new file.
